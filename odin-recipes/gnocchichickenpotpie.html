        <li>/2 cup frozen peas</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a Dutch Oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, melt butter in pan then add carrots, mushrooms, celery, and shallots/onions. Stir to coat the vegetables in butter 
            then saute until the mushrooms release their liquid and it has evaporated, 3-4 minutes. Season with homemade seasoning salt and pepper then continue to saute, turning
            the heat down slightly if necessary, until vegetables are tender, another 6-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, poultry seasoning, and dried thyme then saute until garlic is very fragrant, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over vegetables then stir to combine and cook for 1 minute. Slowly pour in chicken broth while stirring to avoid lumps then add milk and turn heat up to medium-high. 
            Bring mixture to a bubble, stirring occasionally, then add gnocchi and stir combine. Turn heat down to medium then simmer, stirring frequently, until gnocchi are tender, 5-6 minutes. 
            Stir in chicken and peas then taste and add seasoned salt and/or pepper if necessary. Ladle into bowls then serve.</li>
